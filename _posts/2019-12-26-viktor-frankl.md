Below are excerpts from the book by Viktor Frankl. A link to the book is [here](https://www.amazon.com/Feeling-Meaninglessness-Challenge-Psychotherapy-Philosophy/dp/0874627583).


### On Multi-dimensional human beings

* In a sense, man is a computer, but at the same time, man is infinitely more than a computer. Anticipating what I am going to explain and elaborate upon, let me say that man is dimensionally more than just a computer.
* Once that man has been projected into a dimension lower than his own he, too, seems to be a closed system, be it of physiological reflexes or psychological reactions and responses to stimuli. What disappears is the essential openness of human existence, the fact that being human is directed, and pointing, to something, or someone, other than itself.
  The lesson to be learned from existentialism is not nothingness but rather a hyphenated nothing- ness, namely, the no-thingness of the human being. 
* Science is compelled to work with projections—-science cannot do without projections. A scientist is always compelled to shut out the full dimensionality, the intrinsic multidimensionality of reality. He is compelled to behave as if reality were something unidimensional....A scientist, however, must know what he is doing. He must know that he is dependent upon projection in order to refrain from overgeneralization and from reductionist conclusions.

### On Happiness

* Frustration of the will to meaning brings about the will to power as well as the ‘will to pleasure,’ that is, the pleasure principle....The will to pleasure not only contradicts the self-transcendent quality of human reality, but also defeats itself. It is the very pursuit of happiness that thwarts happiness. Happiness cannot be pursued. It must ensue. Happiness is available only as a by-prod- uct, as the side-effect of living out the self-transcendence of existence. Once one has fulfilled one’s meaning or loves another human being, happiness occurs by itself. 
* Logotherapy may help counteract unhealthy trends in the present-day culture of the United States, where the incurable sufferer is given very little opportunity to be proud of his suffering and to consider it ennobling rather than degrading. “Thus,” she writes,“the burden of the unhappy is increased, since he is not only unhappy, but also ashamed of being unhappy.” 
* Actually, pleasure is not the goal of human strivings but rather a by-product of the fulfillment of such strivings; and power is not an end but a means to an end. 
* Man’s search for a meaning is not pathological, but rather the surest sign of being truly human. Even if this search is frustrated, it cannot be considered a sign of disease. It is spiritual distress, not mental disease.

### On Meaning

* What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for some goal worthy of him.
* Life can be made meaningful in a threefold way: First, through what we give to life (in terms of our creative works); second, by what we take from the world (in terms of our experiencing values, be it in nature, or in culture); and third, through the stand we take toward a fate we no longer can change (an incurable disease, an inoperable cancer or the like). However, even apart from this, man is not spared facing his human condition which includes what I call the tragic triad of human existence, namely, pain, death, and guilt. By pain, I mean suffering; by the two other constituents of the tragic triad, I mean the twofold fact of man’s mortality and fallibility.
* We might distinguish between people who are pacemakers while others are peacemakers: the former confront us with meanings and values, thus supporting our meaning orientation; while the latter alleviate the burden of meaning confron- tation. A pacemaker, in this sense, was Moses; he did not soothe man’s conscience but rather stirred it up. Moses confronted his people with the Ten Commandments and did not spare them being confronted with ide- als and values.
And there is the other type of peacemakers. They appease people; they try to reconcile them with themselves. Let‘s face facts, they say. Why worry about one‘s short-comings? Only a minority lives up to ideals. So let‘s forget them; and let‘s care for peace of mind, or soul, rather than those existential meanings which just arouse tensions in human beings.
What the peacemakers overlook is the wisdom laid down in Goethe‘s warning: “If we take man as he is, we make him worse; if we take him as he ought to be, we help him become it.”

### On Freedom

* I am a survivor of 4 camps, that is, concentration camps, and as such I bear witness of the inestimable extent to which man, although he is never free from conditions and determinants, is always free to take a stand to whatever he might have to face. 
* In Logotherapy we speak of the specifically human capacity of self-detachment. This quality, however, not only enables a human being victoriously to overcome himself in a heroic way but also empowers him to deal with himself in an ironic way. 
* Freedom threatens to degenerate into arbitrariness unless it is lived in terms of responsibleness.

### On "Self Actualization"

* What would be the result if a man should merely actualize the potentials within himself? An answer comes to mind in the case of Socrates. He confessed to the potentiality within him to become a criminal and, therefore, if he had succeeded in fully developing his potentialities, the great defender of law and justice would also have been a common criminal! The potentialities of life are not indifferent possibilities, but must be seen in the light of meaning and values. At any given time only one of the possible choices of the individual fulfills the necessity of his life task. 
* Only insofar as a person is capable of ignoring and forgetting himself is he able to recognize anything in and of the world. 
* cognition is true cognition only to the extent in which it is the contrary of mere self expression, only to the extent in which it involves self-transcendence.

### On Error

* Anyone’s conscience, as anything human, is subject to error but this does not release man from his obligation to obey it—existence involves the risk of error. He has to risk committing himself to a cause not worthy of his commitment. Perhaps my commitment to the cause of Logotherapy is erroneous. But I prefer to live in a world in which man has the right to make choices, albeit wrong choices, rather than a world in which no choice at all is left to him. 
* The possibility that my conscience errs implies the possibility that another one‘s conscience is right. This entails humility and modesty. If I am to search for meaning, I have to be certain that there is meaning. If, on the other hand, I cannot be certain that I will find it, I must be tolerant.

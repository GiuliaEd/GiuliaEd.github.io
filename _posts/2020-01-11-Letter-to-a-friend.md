Dear Nessie,


I always thought I'd write you back, but never felt that I would be able to articulate what has really been in my mind. Maybe today is a good time.


Recently I've been thinking about life goal. It's really messy. A lot of life gurus that we see nowadays prescribe glossy, concrete plans, stating that if you adhere to the plan, your dream will come true, and your life will be good. These are not just authors of bestsellers, but also psychologists who want to promote their work in simplistic, "digestible" bites. 


They would be like, "okay, if you divide your long-term goal into small, easier-to-measure tasks, it will be easy for you to prioritize your long-term goal over the trivial daily tasks. " I mean, how can this be simple when the goal itself is nebulous, and when the goalpost is often changing with your life circumstances? And, how can this be simple when your mentors don't fully comprehend your values and ambitions, and give advice that optimizes your chance of career success, which may sometimes be at odds with what you value? 



I recently joined a research project, in which the industry partner aims to design a mobile app that encourages users to drive safer. In a recent meeting, they mentioned: 


"We recently added a feature that gives users rewards when they regularly open the app and use them." 


"How is this serving the goal of motivating them to drive safer?" I asked.


"Oh...part of our goals is also to encourage them to use the app more frequently, so that we can get more data to analyze user behaviors and optimize our app accordingly." He reluctantly replied. 


I believe these are well-intended people--at least at the beginning; otherwise they wouldn't want to design an app to encourage safer driving. But, to satisfy the need to get more data, they put in features that nudge users into spending more time on the app. The users could have spent the time outside their phone to pursue more meaningful things. I feel deeply sad, but I had no idea how to respond. 


One of my advisors told me, "You've got to pick your battles. Don't spend time on things that are hard for you to change on the margin." In previous meetings, a member of my research team proposes using deceptive messages to encourage safer driving. I managed to persuade them against doing so by proposing an alternative that does not involve deception. But, when do you decide this is something worthy of you acting, and when do you decide you'd better let go of it, because "it is not under your direct control"? 


I wonder how we should think about people who succumb to the incentive created by the systems and institutions. As a 20+ young adult, we might be tempted to laugh at people who easily give in, but the reality is messy. The head of the industry partner that we collaborate with feels the responsibility to make his small startup team sustainable, so that the team members will not end up unemployed. 


Yet when we look at the news articles in this country, we see them readily attach labels to people. Wall Street folks are greedy; Silicon Valley folks are evil. I miss places and times when people acknowledge the confusing nature of values and moral judgments, instead of adopting feigned confidence that they know where the moral high ground is. 


Dear friend, what will you think and do if you are in a similar situation?

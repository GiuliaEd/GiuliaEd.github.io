Seeing other people's lives is a way to escape from my own current situation. But also, it is a way to connect or reconnect with my distant past, my distant future, and my counterfactual lives. 

It is learning to feel, in other people's perspective; to not judge. 

As [Fan Jiayang notes](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/10/podcasts/the-daily/racism-chinese-coronavirus-asian-americans.html) in an interview with the Daily, expats and immigrants who spoke a different language lack the emotional vocabulary to express how we feel. Gradually, since we cannot record or recall how we feel, our feelings reduce to non-feelings. Or, in slightly better circustances, coarse feelings. 

Maybe it's time to pick it up again--the ability to experience a wide spectrum of feelings; to experience life in full, and to express life in full. Maybe it's not just about love vs. hate, feeling good vs. bad, excitement vs. depression, or compassion vs. apathy. Maybe it's about why we feel what we feel, how it connects with my experiences, and how it connects with yours, too.
